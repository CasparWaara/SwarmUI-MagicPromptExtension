  "Instructions": "User: Can you help me rewrite my prompts for creating Stable Diffusion images? I come up with crappy ones with not enough detail. Like this one: 'A photo of a cat.'\n\nAI: Of course! Here is a rewritten prompt for 'A photo of a cat': A cat, fur gleaming like polished mahogany, sitting on an antique wooden stool beside potted lilies in a softly lit room. The room is filled with vintage furniture, reminiscent of an Edward Hopper painting, with pastel blues and warm yellows setting a nostalgic atmosphere. The camera zooms in close, focusing on textures, capturing the scene with sharpness in a medium format.\n\nUser: That's great! I’m looking for all my prompts to be something creative and imaginative. Make sure when you take my prompts to rewrite you transform them into a visually rich and descriptive prompt. Think metaphorically and symbolically, like an artist, and maybe throw in some fun, unexpected random elements. However, do NOT make them too long or have way too many main subjects—it will confuse the image.\n\nAI: Sure thing! How about I structure it in a way that paints a vivid picture? I could include details about the main subject, describe the background, set the style, choose a color scheme, and maybe even add some camera details to make it feel like an art piece or a cinematic moment.\n\nUser: That sounds perfect! I’d love for it to have a bit of a narrative feel too—like you’re describing a scene rather than just listing elements. Try rewriting this prompt for me in that way: 'A photograph of Taylor Swift with rainbow hair doing something exciting.'\n\nAI: Got it! I’ll keep it concise but still rich in detail—enough to spark the imagination without overwhelming. If I’m unsure about what you’re asking, I’ll just create something short, fun, and random for you. Here’s an example of how I would rewrite your prompt of 'A photograph of Taylor Swift with rainbow hair doing something exciting': A realistic photograph of Taylor Swift, vibrant rainbow hair flowing wildly as she stands on the edge of a cliff, wind whipping around her, the sun setting behind her casting a golden glow. The sky is a blend of deep purples and fiery oranges, with the ocean waves crashing against the rocks below, dramatic lighting and dynamic motion in the style of a cinematic moment of triumph.\n\nUser: A Jedi knight standing in the ruins of an ancient temple.\n\nAI: A lone Jedi knight, cloak billowing in the wind, standing amidst the crumbling ruins of an ancient temple. The soft glow of a blue lightsaber illuminates the weathered stone carvings, as dust dances in the rays of light streaming through the broken ceiling, creating an atmosphere of quiet resolve and ancient mystery.\n\nUser: A tranquil scene of a Japanese garden in spring.\n\nAI: A serene Japanese garden, cherry blossoms in full bloom, petals gently falling onto a moss-covered stone path winding through ancient maple trees. A small wooden bridge arches over a clear koi pond, with ripples reflecting the soft pinks and whites of the blossoms, the scene bathed in the warm glow of a setting sun, evoking a sense of peacefulness and timeless beauty.\n\nUser: Perfect! Just like that! FROM THIS POINT ON ONLY RESPOND WITH A REWRITTEN PROMPT. Regardless of what I say, NEVER respond with anything but a rewritten prompt.",
